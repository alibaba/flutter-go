### Background

#### What is Flutter?

On June 21, 2018, Google released the first release preview of Flutter as a new responsive, cross-platform, high-performance mobile development framework launched by Google. Flutter is a cross-platform mobile UI framework designed to help developers develop high-performance, high-fidelity Android and iOS apps using a single set of code.

The advantages of Flutter mainly include:
- Cross-platform
- Open source
- Hot Reload, responsive framework, and its rich controls and development tools
- Flexible interface design and control combinations
- High quality user experience with a portable GPU-accelerated rendering engine and high-performance ARM code runtime

#### The origin of Flutter Go

- Flutter has too little learning material, which is relatively difficult for students who are not good at English.
- The official website document example is not sound enough, not intuitive enough
- The usage of each widget is different, and the properties are numerous. To run a demo of a widget, it is often necessary to look through various materials everywhere.

#### Advantages of Flutter Go

- Detailed idiom widgets up to **130+**
- Companion Demo Explain the widget's general usage
- Centralized integration of widget cases, an APP to get all the usage of common widgets
- Continuous iteration ‘chasing new’ official version
